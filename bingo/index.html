              <i>Goal:</i> The goal of this activity is to encourage all
              participants to meet a variety of different people, especially
              beyond the group that they are working with.
            </p>

            <p>
              Your job is to meet people with the following characteristics.
              Please wander around the Yotribe room, join a group, introduce
              yourself (full name, affiliation, and location), then see if
              anyone in the group has one of the attributes on your card. When
              you find someone who has one of the attributes on your card, click
              on that square to mark it as complete. If your card
              <a href="/bingo/patterns.jpg"
                >shows any of these winning patterns</a
              >, let your circle know and feel pride wash over you!
