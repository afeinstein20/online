            A 48-hour international
            <i>collaboration &amp; co-working</i> event focused on
            <a

              >NASA's TESS Mission</a

            <h3>Structure &amp; program</h3>

            <p>
              This is a <i>working meeting</i> in the style of a hack week or
              sprint and there won't be any talks. Instead, the goal is to
              encourage participants to work together to learn something new,
              meet people with complementary skills, and create something useful
              (in the form of a software package, a paper, an idea, or something
              else that we haven't thought of yet).
            </p>
            <p>
              The specific schedule of the program is still being developed, but
              the time will be mostly unstructured and participants will not be
              expected to participate outside of their usual working hours. In
              advance, participants asynchronously introduce themselves and
              pitch project ideas to the rest of the group. Then, we will
              self-organize into groups, split up the work, and collaborate on
              the project for the two days of the program. At the end, all
              participants will asynchronously share what they learned or
              achieved with the rest of the group.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are working to develop a schedule and a set of project
              management recommendations to encourage and support collaborations
              across time zones. But, this is also an experiment, so all
              participants are encouraged to join with an open mind, enthusiasm
              about building new collaborations, and a willingness to change
              plans if (when) things don't proceed as expected.
            </p>

            <h3>Applications are open!</h3>

            <h3>Organizing committee</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Guy Davies</strong> (University of Birmingham)</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dan Foreman-Mackey</strong> (Flatiron Institute, chair)

            </ul>

            <h3>Collaboration policy</h3>
            <p>
              To ensure transparency and openness, we have adopted the
              <a href="http://gaia.lol/codeofconduct.html"
                >collaboration policy developed for the Gaia Sprints</a
              >. This policy requires that participants agree to the following:
            </p>
            <p>
              All participants will be expected to openly share their ideas,
              expertise, code, and interim results. Project development will
              proceed out in the open, among participants and in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participants will be encouraged to change gears, start new
              collaborations, and combine projects. Any participant who
              contributes significantly to a project can expect co-authorship on
              resulting scientific papers, and any participant who gets
              significant contributions to a project is expected to include
              those contributors as co-authors.
            </p>
            <p>
              These rules make it
              <i
                >inadvisable to bring proprietary data sets or proprietary
                code</i
              >, unless the participant bringing such assets has the rights to
              open them or add collaborators.
            </p>

            <h3 id="codeofconduct">Code of conduct</h3>
            <p>
              We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference

              abusive behavior, or intimidation of conference participants in
              any form. As such, we follow the
