Dear colleagues,

I am writing to let you know about https://online.tess.science, a fully-remote, international collaboration and co-working event focused on NASA's TESS Mission and held 8-10 September, 2020. This will be in the spirit of the https://tess.science series of meetings where astronomers with a broad range of expertise gather to work together on TESS-related projects and learn from each other. This fully-remote version of the program will attempt to capture some of the best parts of the in-person meetings while enabling broader participation since no international travel is required.

The detailed logistics and schedule of the program have not yet been finalized and more details will be forthcoming. But, to help with our planning, we ask that you let us know if you're interested in participating by filling out this (non-binding) form: https://forms.gle/R8qFkQtWUYXJDmac6

Please spread the word and forward this email to anyone who might be interested in participating!

Best,

Dan Foreman-Mackey
on behalf of the SOC
